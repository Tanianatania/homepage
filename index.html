                    times riding a Jet Ski. The actor was recently seen playing with the waves, riding a Jet Ski with
                    his girlfriend Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, in the marvelous vacation destination St. Barts. Jason’s
                    love for water sport activities is evident from the fact that he was also an active member of
                    Britain’s National Diving Squad for almost twelve years.</p>
